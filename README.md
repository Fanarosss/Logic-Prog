# Logical Programming

Various puzzles and problems, solved with logical and constraint programming using prolog
* Activities: Distributing activities between executors
* Assignment_csp: Same as above, distributing activities, but solved with Constraint Satifaction Programming and it is way more fast.
* DiSnake: string computations
* NumPart: find all subsets of an interval with CSP
* MaxSat: Maximum Satisfaction problem with CSP (bb_min for optimization)

Used ECLiPSe software for the implementations
